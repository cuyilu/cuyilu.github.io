    <content type="text"><![CDATA[说点心里话 看完宫崎骏的《侧耳倾听》。 就是这种感觉，时时挂念，时时想为对方做点什么，当时不懂，过了这么多年了才知道原来就是这么简单纯粹的情感。二十六岁的我并没有十八岁的我聪明，一直停留在原地。现在问我，我还是会骑着自行车载着你翻山越岭，想见你的心情还是如同你那天晚上唱的《身骑白马》。 其实这段话只你看得到，而你应该也是看不到，当做写给自己看吧，也是无缘再与你生活有交集了。以前的我反感自己这么矫情，但，想你如果是矫情的话那我的情感就真的支离破碎，一无所有了。 现在明白了，不是因为寂寞，也不是因为失去才是最美，是因为当初遇见你、后来分开后后知觉地发现你才是可以让我完全吸引，完全默契的那个，因为当时不知觉地喜欢你，我也喜欢上和你相处时的那个我。现在我开始接受想你的我，毕竟这份想念感觉是这一辈子的了。或许我会继续努力前行，或许不再往前，但想起你已经慢慢从深深的沉石变成习惯的心头填充。 “你在干嘛呢?这周末去徒步去不去？” “好啊。” “太好了!”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[THE ENCHIRIDION]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F11%2F12%2FEnchiridion1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[好书共勉 Author: Epictetus(c.55-c.135) was a Roman slave who defended the moral theory of Stoicism, according to which the good life can be achieved by ajusting one’s desires to the way the world is rather than trying ro adjust the world to satisafy one’s desires. THE ENCHIRIDIONI There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs. Now the things within our power are by nature free, unrestricted, unhindered; but those beyond our power are weak, dependent, restricted, alien. Remember, then, that if you attribute freedom to things by nature dependent and take what belongs to others for your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you take for your own only that which is your own and view what belongs to others just as it really is, then no one will ever compel you, no one will restrict you; you will find fault with no one, you will accuse no one, you will do nothing against your will; no one will hurt you, you will not have an enemy, nor will you suffer any harm. Aiming, therefore, at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself any inclination, however slight, toward the attainment of the others; but that you must entirely quit some of them, and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would have these, and possess power and wealth likewise, you may miss the latter in seeking the former; and you will certainly fail of that by which alone happiness and freedom are procured. Seek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing semblance, “You are but a semblance and by no means the real thing.” And then examine it by those rules which [18] you have; and first and chiefly by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you. II Remember that desire demands the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion demands the avoidance of that to which you are averse; that he who fails of the object of his desires is disappointed; and he who incurs the object of his aversion is wretched. If, then, you shun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will never incur anything which you shun; but if you shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness. Remove [the habit of] aversion, then, from all things that are not within our power, and apply it to things undesirable which are within our power. But for the present, altogether restrain desire; for if you desire any of the things not within our own power, you must necessarily be disappointed; and you are not yet secure of those which are within our power, and so are legitimate objects of desire. Where it is practically necessary for you to pursue or avoid anything, do even this with discretion and gentleness and moderation. III With regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute to use or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup, that it is but a cup of which you are fond of—for thus, if it is broken, you can bear it; if you embrace your child or your wife, that you embrace a mortal—and thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it. IV When you set about any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, represent to [19] yourself the incidents usual in the bath—some persons pouring out, others pushing in, others scolding, others pilfering. And thus you will more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, “I will now go to bathe and keep my own will in harmony with nature.” And so with regard to every other action. For thus, if any impediment arises in bathing, you will be able to say, “It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my will in harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus if I am out of humor at things that happen.” V Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves—that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself. VI Be not elated at any excellence not your own. If a horse should be elated, and say, “I am handsome,” it might be endurable. But when you are elated and say, “I have a handsome horse,” know that you are elated only on the merit of the horse. What then is your own? The use of the phenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in this respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be elated at some good of your own. VII As in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you go on shore to get water, you may amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish or a truffle in your way, but your thoughts ought [20] to be bent toward the ship, and perpetually attentive, lest the captain should call, and then you must leave all these things, that you may not have to be carried on board the vessel, bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead of a truffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or a child be granted you, there is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these things, and never look behind. But if you are old, never go far from the ship, lest you should be missing when called for. VIII Demand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well. IX Sickness is an impediment to the body, but not to the will unless itself pleases. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will; and say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens. For you will find it to be an impediment to something else, but not truly to yourself. X Upon every accident, remember to turn toward yourself and inquire what faculty you have for its use. If you encounter a handsome person, you will find continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then patience. And when thus habituated, the phenomena of existence will not overwhelm you. XI Never say of anything, “I have lost it,” but, “I have restored it.” Has your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. “But it was a bad man who took it.” What [21] is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has demanded it again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as something not your own, as do travelers at an inn. XII If you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: “If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will be good for nothing.” For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy. Begin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilled or a little wine stolen? Say to yourself, “This is the price paid for peace and tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing.” And when you call your servant, consider that it is possible he may not come at your call; or, if he does, that he may not do what you wish. But it is not at all desirable for him, and very undesirable for you, that it should be in his power to cause you any disturbance. XIII If you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. For be assured, it is not easy at once to keep your will in harmony with nature and to secure externals; but while you are absorbed in the one, you must of necessity neglect the other. XIV If you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so, and what belongs to others to be your own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be without fault, you are foolish, for you wish vice not to be vice but [22] something else. But if you wish not to be disappointed in your desires, that is in your own power. Exercise, therefore, what is in your power. A man’s master is he who is able to confer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave. XV Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire toward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them, deservedly became divine, and were so recognized. XVI When you see anyone weeping for grief, either that his son has gone abroad or that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the apparent evil, but discriminate and be ready to say, “What hurts this man is not this occurrence itself—for another man might not be hurt by it—but the view he chooses to take of it.” As far as conversation goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to him and, if need be, to groan with him. Take heed, however, not to groan inwardly, too. XVII Remember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author chooses—if short, then in a short one; if long, [23] then in a long one. If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your business—to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another. XVIII When a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not overcome by appearances, but discriminate and say, “Nothing is portended to me, either to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to me all portents are lucky if I will. For whatsoever happens, it belongs to me to derive advantage therefrom.” XIX You can be unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer. When, therefore, you see anyone eminent in honors or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be bewildered by appearances and to pronounce him happy; for if the essence of good consists in things within our own power, there will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things which lie not within our own power. XX Remember that it is not he who gives abuse or blows, who affronts, but the view we take of these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be bewildered by appearances. For if you once gain time and respite, you will more easily command yourself. [24]XXI Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily before your eyes, but death chiefly; and you will never entertain an abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything. XXII If you have an earnest desire toward philosophy, prepare yourself from the very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, “He is returned to us a philosopher all at once”; and, “Whence this supercilious look?” Now, for your part, do not have a supercilious look indeed, but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you, as one appointed by God to this particular station. For remember that, if you are persistent, those very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule. XXIII If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be content, then, in everything, with being a philosopher; and if you wish to seem so likewise to anyone, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you. XXIV Let not such considerations as these distress you: “I shall live in discredit and be nobody anywhere.” For if discredit be an evil, you can no more be involved in evil through another than in baseness. Is it any business of yours, then, to get power or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How then, after all, is this discredit? And how it is true that you [25] will be nobody anywhere when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are within your own power, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? “But my friends will be unassisted.” What do you mean by “unassisted”? They will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who told you, then, that these are among the things within our own power, and not rather the affairs of others? And who can give to another the things which he himself has not? “Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a share.” If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and self-respect, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require me to lose my own proper good, that you may gain what is no good, consider how unreasonable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather have, a sum of money or a faithful and honorable friend? Rather assist me, then, to gain this character than require me to do those things by which I may lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends upon me, will be unassisted. Here, again, what assistance is this you mean? It will not have porticos nor baths of your providing? And what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with shoes, nor a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if everyone fully performs his own proper business. And were you to supply it with another faithful and honorable citizen, would not he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to it. “What place, then,” say you, “shall I hold in the state?” Whatever you can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring to be useful to that, you lose these, how can you serve your country when you have become faithless and shameless? XXV Is anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, or in courtesies, or in confidential intercourse? If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that he has them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved that you have them not. And remember [26] that you cannot be permitted to rival others in externals without using the same means to obtain them. For how can he who will not haunt the door of any man, will not attend him, will not praise him, have an equal share with him who does these things? You are unjust, then, and unreasonable if you are unwilling to pay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for nothing. For how much are lettuces sold? An obulus, for instance. If another, then, paying an obulus, takes the lettuces, and you, not paying it, go without them, do not imagine that he has gained any advantage over you. For as he has the lettuces, so you have the obulus which you did not give. So, in the present case, you have not been invited to such a person’s entertainment because you have not paid him the price for which a supper is sold. It is sold for praise; it is sold for attendance. Give him, then, the value if it be for your advantage. But if you would at the same time not pay the one, and yet receive the other, you are unreasonable and foolish. Have you nothing, then, in place of the supper? Yes, indeed, you have—not to praise him whom you do not like to praise; not to bear the insolence of his lackeys. XXVI The will of nature may be learned from things upon which we are all agreed. As when our neighbor’s boy has broken a cup, or the like, we are ready at once to say, “These are casualties that will happen”; be assured, then, that when your own cup is likewise broken, you ought to be affected just as when another’s cup was broken. Now apply this to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, “This is an accident of mortality.” But if anyone’s own child happens to die, it is immediately, “Alas! how wretched am I!” It should be always remembered how we are affected on hearing the same thing concerning others. [27]XXVII As a mark[1] is not set up for the sake of missing the aim, so neither does the nature of evil exist in the world. XXVIII If a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in delivering up your own mind to any reviler, to be disconcerted and confounded? XXIX[2] In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit, indeed, careless of the consequences, and when these are developed, you will shamefully desist. “I would conquer at the Olympic Games.” But consider what precedes and what follows, and then, if it be for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, and sometimes no wine—in a word, you must give yourself up to your trainer as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow an abundance of dust, receive stripes [for negligence], and, after all, lose the victory. When you have reckoned up all this, if your inclination still holds, set about the combat. Otherwise, take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy, [28] when they happen to have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, and another a gladiator; now a philosopher, now an orator; but nothing in earnest. Like an ape you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything considerately; nor after having surveyed and tested the whole matter, but carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Thus some, when they have seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates[3]—though, indeed, who can speak like him?—have a mind to be philosophers, too. Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do you think that you can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob. XXX Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a certain man your father? In this are implied taking care of him, submitting [29] to him in all things, patiently receiving his reproaches, his correction. But he is a bad father. Is your natural tie, then, to a good father? No, but to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, preserve your own just relation toward him. Consider not what he does, but what you are to do to keep your own will in a state conformable to nature, for another cannot hurt you unless you please. You will then be hurt when you consent to be hurt. In this manner, therefore, if you accustom yourself to contemplate the relations of neighbor, citizen, commander, you can deduce from each the corresponding duties. XXXI Be assured that the essence of piety toward the gods lies in this—to form right opinions concerning them, as existing and as governing the universe justly and well. And fix yourself in this resolution, to obey them, and yield to them, and willingly follow them amidst all events, as being ruled by the most perfect wisdom. For thus you will never find fault with the gods, nor accuse them of neglecting you. And it is not possible for this to be affected in any other way than by withdrawing yourself from things which are not within our own power, and by making good or evil to consist only in those which are. For if you suppose any other things to be either good or evil, it is inevitable that, when you are disappointed of what you wish or incur what you would avoid, you should reproach and blame their authors. For every creature is naturally formed to flee and abhor things that appear hurtful and that which causes them; and to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial and that which causes them. It is impracticable, then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt should rejoice in the person who, as he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible to rejoice in the hurt itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by his son when he does not impart the things which seem to be good; and this made Polynices [30] and Eteocles[4] mutually enemies—that empire seemed good to both. On this account the husbandman reviles the gods; [and so do] the sailor, the merchant, or those who have lost wife or child. For where our interest is, there, too, is piety directed. So that whoever is careful to regulate his desires and aversions as he ought is thus made careful of piety likewise. But it also becomes incumbent on everyone to offer libations and sacrifices and first fruits, according to the customs of his country, purely, and not heedlessly nor negligently; not avariciously, nor yet extravagantly. XXXII When you have recourse to divination, remember that you know not what the event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; but of what nature it is you knew before coming; at least, if you are of philosophic mind. For if it is among the things not within our own power, it can by no means be either good or evil. Do not, therefore, bring with you to the diviner either desire or aversion—else you will approach him trembling—but first clearly understand that every event is indifferent and nothing to you, of whatever sort it may be; for it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder. Then come with confidence to the gods as your counselors; and afterwards, when any counsel is given you, remember what counselors you have assumed, and whose advice you will neglect if you disobey. Come to divination as Socrates prescribed, in cases of which the whole consideration relates to the event, and in which no opportunities are afforded by reason or any other art to discover the matter in view. When, therefore, it is our duty to share the danger of a friend or of our country, we ought not to consult the oracle as to whether we shall share it with them or not. For though the diviner should forewarn you that the auspices are unfavorable, this means no more than [31] that either death or mutilation or exile is portended. But we have reason within us; and it directs us, even with these hazards, to stand by our friend and our country. Attend, therefore, to the greater diviner, the Pythian God, who once cast out of the temple him who neglected to save his friend.[5] XXXIII Begin by prescribing to yourself some character and demeanor, such as you may preserve both alone and in company. Be mostly silent, or speak merely what is needful, and in few words. We may, however, enter sparingly into discourse sometimes, when occasion calls for it; but let it not run on any of the common subjects, as gladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or food, or drink—the vulgar topics of conversation—and especially not on men, so as either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons. If you are able, then, by your own conversation, bring over that of your company to proper subjects; but if you happen to find yourself among strangers, be silent. Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant. Avoid taking oaths, if possible, altogether; at any rate, so far as you are able. Avoid public and vulgar entertainments; but if ever an occasion calls you to them, keep your attention upon the stretch, that you may not imperceptibly slide into vulgarity. For be assured that if a person be ever so pure himself, yet, if his companion be corrupted, he who converses with him will be corrupted likewise. Provide things relating to the body no further than absolute need requires, as meat, drink, clothing, house, retinue. But cut off everything that looks toward show and luxury. [32]Before marriage guard yourself with all your ability from unlawful intercourse with women; yet be not uncharitable or severe to those who are led into this, nor boast frequently that you yourself do otherwise. If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: “He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.” It is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles; but if ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, do not appear more solicitous for any other than for yourself—that is, wish things to be only just as they are, and only the best man to win; for thus nothing will go against you. But abstain entirely from acclamations and derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, do not discourse a great deal on what has passed and what contributes nothing to your own amendment. For it would appear by such discourse that you were dazzled by the show. Be not prompt or ready to attend private recitations; but if you do attend, preserve your gravity and dignity, and yet avoid making yourself disagreeable. When you are going to confer with anyone, and especially with one who seems your superior, represent to yourself how Socrates or Zeno[6] would behave in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to meet properly whatever may occur. When you are going before anyone in power, fancy to yourself that you may not find him at home, that you may be shut out, that the doors may not be opened to you, that he may not notice you. If, with all this, it be your duty to go, bear what happens and never say to yourself, “It was not worth so much”; for this is vulgar, and like a man bewildered by externals. In company, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions and dangers. For however agreeable it may be to yourself to allude to the risks you have run, it is not [33] equally agreeable to others to hear your adventures. Avoid likewise an endeavor to excite laughter, for this may readily slide you into vulgarity, and, besides, may be apt to lower you in the esteem of your acquaintance. Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous. Therefore, when anything of this sort happens, use the first fit opportunity to rebuke him who makes advances that way, or, at least, by silence and blushing and a serious look show yourself to be displeased by such talk. XXXIV If you are dazzled by the semblance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself against being bewildered by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both points of time—that in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself, after you have enjoyed it—and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will rejoice and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even though it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticements and allurements and seductions may not subdue you, but set in opposition to this how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a victory. XXXV When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shrink from being seen to do it, even though the world should misunderstand it; for if you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself; if you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you? XXXVI As the proposition, “either it is day or it is night,” has much force in a disjunctive argument, but none at all in a conjunctive one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is [34] very suitable to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit of the entertainment. Remember, then, when you eat with another, not only the value to the body of those things which are set before you, but also the value of proper courtesy toward your host. XXXVII If you have assumed any character beyond your strength, you have both demeaned yourself ill in that and quitted one which you might have supported. XXXVIII As in walking you take care not to tread upon a nail, or turn your foot, so likewise take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. And if we were to guard against this in every action, we should enter upon action more safely. XXXIX The body is to everyone the proper measure of its possessions, as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will keep the measure; but if you move beyond it, you must necessarily be carried forward, as down a precipice; as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds the fit measure there is no bound. XL Women from fourteen years old are flattered by men with the title of mistresses. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded only as qualified to give men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, and in that to place all their hopes. It is worth while, therefore, to try that they may perceive themselves honored only so far as they appear beautiful in their demeanor and modestly virtuous. [35]XLI It is a mark of want of intellect to spend much time in things relating to the body, as to be immoderate in exercises, in eating and drinking, and in the discharge of other animal functions. These things should be done incidentally and our main strength be applied to our reason. XLII When any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts or speaks from an impression that it is right for him to do so. Now it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but only what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from false appearances, he is the person hurt, since he, too, is the person deceived. For if anyone takes a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but only the man is deceived. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear with a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, “It seemed so to him.” XLIII Everything has two handles: one by which it may be borne, another by which it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, do not lay hold on the affair by the handle of his injustice, for by that it cannot be borne, but rather by the opposite—that he is your brother, that he was brought up with you; and thus you will lay hold on it as it is to be borne. XLIV These reasonings have no logical connection: “I am richer than you, therefore I am your superior.” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am your superior.” The true logical connection is rather this: “I am richer than you, therefore my possessions must exceed yours.” “I am more eloquent [36] than you, therefore my style must surpass yours.” But you, after all, consist neither in property nor in style. XLV Does anyone bathe hastily? Do not say that he does it ill, but hastily. Does anyone drink much wine? Do not say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great deal. For unless you perfectly understand his motives, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to any appearances but such as you fully comprehend. XLVI Never proclaim yourself a philosopher, nor make much talk among the ignorant about your principles, but show them by actions. Thus, at an entertainment, do not discourse how people ought to eat, but eat as you ought. For remember that thus Socrates also universally avoided all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be introduced by him to philosophers, he took them and introduced them; so well did he bear being overlooked. So if ever there should be among the ignorant any discussion of principles, be for the most part silent. For there is great danger in hastily throwing out what is undigested. And if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have really entered on your work. For sheep do not hastily throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten, but, inwardly digesting their food, they produce it outwardly in wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you not make an exhibition before the ignorant of your principles, but of the actions to which their digestion gives rise. XLVII When you have learned to nourish your body frugally, do not pique yourself upon it; nor, if you drink water, be saying upon every occasion, “I drink water.” But first consider how [37] much more frugal are the poor than we, and how much more patient of hardship. If at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to labor and privation, for your own sake and not for the public, do not attempt great feats; but when you are violently thirsty, just rinse your mouth with water, and tell nobody. XLVIII The condition and characteristic of a vulgar person is that he never looks for either help or harm from himself, but only from externals. The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is that he looks to himself for all help or harm. The marks of a proficient are that he censures no one, praises no one, blames no one, accuses no one; says nothing concerning himself as being anybody or knowing anything. When he is in any instance hindered or restrained, he accuses himself; and if he is praised, he smiles to himself at the person who praises him; and if he is censured, he makes no defense. But he goes about with the caution of a convalescent, careful of interference with anything that is doing well but not yet quite secure. He restrains desire; he transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the proper use of our own will; he employs his energies moderately in all directions; if he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not care; and, in a word, he keeps watch over himself as over an enemy and one in ambush. XLIX When anyone shows himself vain on being able to understand and interpret the works of Chrysippus,[7] say to yourself: “Unless Chrysippus had written obscurely, this person would have had nothing to be vain of. But what do I desire? [38] To understand nature, and follow her. I ask, then, who interprets her; and hearing that Chrysippus does, I have recourse to him. I do not understand his writings. I seek, therefore, one to interpret them.” So far there is nothing to value myself upon. And when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make use of his instructions. This alone is the valuable thing. But if I admire merely the interpretation, what do I become more than a grammarian, instead of a philosopher, except, indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret Chrysippus? When anyone, therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I cannot exhibit actions that are harmonious and consonant with his discourse. L Whatever rules you have adopted, abide by them as laws, and as if you would be impious to transgress them; and do not regard what anyone says of you, for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then, will you delay to demand of yourself the noblest improvements, and in no instance to transgress the judgments of reason? You have received the philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been conversant with them. For what other master, then, do you wait as an excuse for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer a boy but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind. This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and that by one failure and defeat honor may be lost or—won. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving himself by everything, following [39] reason alone. And though you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to live as one seeking to be a Socrates. LI The first and most necessary topic in philosophy is the practical application of principles, as, We ought not to lie; the second is that of demonstrations as, Why it is that we ought not to lie; the third, that which gives strength and logical connection to the other two, as, Why this is a demonstration. For what is demonstration? What is a consequence? What a contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The third point is then necessary on account of the second; and the second on account of the first. But the most necessary, and that whereon we ought to rest, is the first. But we do just the contrary. For we spend all our time on the third point and employ all our diligence about that, and entirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that we lie, we are very ready to show how it is demonstrated that lying is wrong. Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand: Conduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,Wherever your decrees have fixed my lot.I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,Wicked and wretched, I must follow still.[8]Who’er yields properly to Fate is deemedWise among men, and knows the laws of Heaven.[9]And this third: “O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be.”[10] “Anytus and Melitus may kill me indeed; but hurt me they cannot.”[11] Footnotes [1]Happiness, the effect of virtue, is the mark which God has set up for us to aim at. Our missing it is no work of His; nor so properly anything real, as a mere negative and failure of our own.[2][Chapter XV of the third book of the Discourses, which, with the exception of some very trifling differences, is the same as chapter XXIX of the Enchiridion.—Ed.][3]Euphrates was a philosopher of Syria, whose character is described, with the highest encomiums, by Pliny the Younger, Letters I. 10.[4][The two inimical sons of Oedipus, who killed each other in battle.—Ed.][5][This refers to an anecdote given in full by Simplicius, in his commentary on this passage, of a man assaulted and killed on his way to consult the oracle, while his companion, deserting him, took refuge in the temple till cast out by the Deity.—Tr.][6][Reference is to Zeno of Cyprus (335-263 B.C.), the founder of the Stoic school.—Ed.][7][Chrysippus (c. 280-207 B.C.) was a Stoic philosopher who became head of the Stoa after Cleanthes.

    <url>%2F2017%2F11%2F08%2FCognitive-dissonance2%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[认知失调的现实意义 认知失调2上次我们讲了什么叫「认知失调」，举了减肥吃甜品后悔的例子，简单介绍了三个实验：诱导服从实验、玩具剥夺实验以及努力辩护效应。这些实验也同时说明了当人的态度和所面临的环境选择发生冲突时，需要借助外部力量（奖励或惩罚）来缓解失调，如果外部力量不够，则需要自己通过内部力量来证明自己行为的合理性，从而恢复认知平衡。或反过来，如果行动在前，对于付诸行动的预期与环境选择发生冲突，则会通过改变对环境的认知来证明自己行动的有效性，导致自己“欺骗”自己。 说了这些实验和理论，他们有哪些现实意义呢？ 首先在教育领域，制造和消除认知失调可以很好的调动学生的积极性。如果家长想要让孩子养成某种（费时费力）好习惯，不妨在最开始用上一点强迫，让他们不得不持续地执行这件本不愿做的事情。一段时间过后，他们对这件事情的态度会逐渐向着积极方向转变。这种方法和「努力辩护效应」是相对应的，“如果我花费了时间精力去做某件事情，那么它一定是有意义的”。 那么我们也可以反过来思考一下，如果我们很看重某件事情，这件事情对于自己来说意义重大，有没有可能是因为自己在进行「努力辩护」，而这件事本身并没有那么重要？所谓“吾日三省吾身”，有这样的反思可以打破自己的行为定式和帮助自己跳出惯性思维方面。 和「诱导服从研究」相对应的是一种减少奖励的教育方法。诱导服从研究告诉我们，外在激励和内在动力是一种此消彼长的关系。如果做一件事情的外部激励很大，那么行为主体在外部激励消失后丧失继续做这件事情的积极性。实验表明，如果在幼儿完成拼图后给一定的奖励，他们对拼图的兴趣会远远低于没有奖励的对照组。从这实验结果我们可以知道：外在的奖励是不足以让我们对一件事情产生真正的兴趣，内在的动力才是真正的意义驱动轮。（或者可以这么想，当你把拼图和外在奖励挂钩后，之后驱使你玩拼图的动力变得不稳定，而不稳定的动力会消减你对拼图的兴趣。内在动力是才最稳定最强大，内在动力可以只专注拼图本身，不分散注意力到外在奖励上，可以更加合理化自己行为。） 「认知失调理论」在市场营销领域也运用的很多。比如，消费者在完成一次购买行为后，如果发现同一产品还有更加低廉的价格，有同感的你是不是当时感觉到整个人都不好了，这种感受也是认知失调。为了缓解认知失调的不适感，我们会进行对应的心理“自我安慰”。 持续搜寻有利信息。当你发现你在某东买贵了，因为在某宝的价格偏低，于是你接下来的行为就是再去其他电商如某宁，某逊等，如果发现这些电商的价格和某东比较接近，我们也就完成了一次“自我安慰”：某宝质量肯定不过关，还好自己买对了 。 改变态度。这次你货比三家了，发现自己真的是买贵了，怎么办，总不能揍自己一顿吧，于是你通过态度改变：质量最重要了，一分钱一分货嘛。（本来冲着价格，现在安慰自己价格不是首选条件了） 不要是因为不值。这次你面对“套餐”的诱惑，如果套餐不够优惠，我们会说服自己，那些套餐其实有隐形收费，还不如不要。 知道了这些信息，你就可以在通过一些推销手段卖高价格后“安慰安慰”一下你的消费者，告诉他们：您的消费是非常理智的，并没有被宰，因为我们的产品质量过硬，服务周到balabla，消除消费者的认知失调，让消费者心理舒坦了，从而认可了你的产品和价格，你就“理所当然”地可以底本高售了。 上面只是列举了认知失调的某一些应用，但在生活中，你会遇到更多和自己想象中不一样的事情，你是怎么接受那些事情呢？你是苦苦纠结还是欣然接受呢？希望你可以通过对认知失调的学习与思考找到一丝线索或启示。「认知失调」就讲到这，下次再聊。 以上]]></content>

    <url>%2F2017%2F11%2F07%2FCognitive_dissonance1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[记录与分享认知失调的几个有趣的实验 认知失调（Cognitive dissonance）当我们的行为和态度（自认为正确道德或形象等认知）之间出现不一致，在心理上我们会经历一个叫做「认知失调」的过程。下面举一个减肥的例子。假设你正处于减肥期，本应少吃高热量食品。但有一天你还是没忍住甜食的诱惑，吃了一个高热量的甜点。这个时候你心里会产生后悔的感觉。这种纠结的感觉其实就是认知失调：你的态度（胖子不该吃高热量）和你的行为（吃高热量食品）产生冲突，这种冲突会给你大脑或者说心理带来巨大的负荷，为了减少或者摆脱这种失调的不适感（Dissonance Reduction），你有四个选择（往往你会习惯偏向于其中一种选择）： 改变你的认知或行为：我以后再也不吃这种甜品了，并提醒自己不会再犯。或者是减肥简直是虐待自己，我爱我自己，不减了。 通过调整不一致的认知来证明刚刚这种吃甜品的行为是合理的：减肥这么辛苦，我可以分阶段进行，现在可以稍微放纵一下（不吃饭，怎么有力气减肥！）。 通过增加新的认知来证明行为的合理：今天吃了甜品，那晚上我多运动半小时。 最常见的就是直接忽视甚至否认和现有态度违背的信息：其实这种甜品没那么高热量了啦，吃这种食品不影响我减肥。 以上例子让你对认知失调有个初步的印象。接下来仔细想想，当你真的吃了那个甜品产生了后悔的感觉之后做出的行为是你仔细思考后的行为还是“下意识”做的？是不是有些时候你就不知不觉改变了对于减肥或者甜品的态度？这就是「认知失调」理论伟大的地方：提出了人的行为对态度转变或持续的先行作用。简单地说，就是相对于之前的态度先于行为的认识（有了某种态度才能执行某种行为），「认知失调」理论告诉我们，原来行为在某些条件下也可以先于态度（当我们做出某种行为之后对态度产生的影响）。以下这句话可能你会觉得在哪听过，其实就是你有时候这么做了不知觉而感到熟悉而已。 You can learn to like to do something (or at least become more comfortable with it) by “just doing it” and continuing to do it, even if you initially don’t want to.– Ten Interesting Things in Human Behavior 那么知道了「认知失调」理论，接下来看看「认知失调」理论能具体怎么解释我们的一些知行失调，最终指导我们改善我们的知行。认知失调的实验验证研究主要有四个方向： 信仰冲突研究（Belief disconfirmation paradigm）：研究人们对与其信仰相冲突的信息是如何反应，如何处理的。 诱导服从研究（Induced-compliance paradigm）：在人们被要求做与其原有认知态度相冲突的事情后，他们的认知和态度会发生怎么样的转变。 决策后研究（Free-choice paradigm）：在人们做出决策后，他们原有的认知和态度会发生哪些转变。 心血（努力）辩护效研究（Effort-justification paradigm）：人们自愿在某件事中投入大量的时间和精力后，原有的对这件事情的认知会有哪些转变。 没错，坏坏的你正在想第二点的诱导服从是怎么实现的，说自己看到的是“制服诱惑”请去面墙三分钟再回来继续阅读。》》》好了，三分钟过去了，我继续写。诱导服从实验其实就是坏坏的，当然不是制fu…（咳咳。。），总之呢，实验设计的主要内容就是，让你去做一件特别无聊的事情（比如绕线），接着让你去说服别人“绕线就是这么有趣！”。这种实验通常会分两组进行对比，也是设立对照组，报酬少的组（比如1元）和报酬多的组（比如20元）。实验结果让人很有点吃惊：相较于报酬多的组，报酬少的被试反而对这项无聊的任务表现出更高的热情和更加积极的态度。 你要是一个老板听到这实验结果肯定很开心。。。 喂醒醒，你，就是你，认真听课。 那么为什么报酬少的反而更加积极呢？这里就要讲到「认知失调」理论的假设，假设“人类会本能地寻求行为与态度的协调一致”，也就是说人遭遇「认知失调」时就会寻求减轻失调的方式。对于报酬少的那组，他们的态度（绕线很无聊）和他们的行为（说服别人绕线很有趣）之间的失调无法通过外部力量（1元的报酬）来缓解，这个时候他们就要寻求内部力量，即改变自己原有的认知和态度来恢复认知平衡。相反的，报酬多的那组在面对同样的「认知失调」时，他们可以通过外部力量（20元）来证明自己的行为是有意义的，那么他们就不需要通过改变态度来恢复认知平衡。 除了奖励可以抵消认知失调，惩罚同样可以。玩具剥夺实验就说明了这一点。把四岁的小孩分为两组，分别放在房间里面玩玩具。组A的儿童被告知，房间里面有一样玩具不可以玩，违反会受到严重惩罚；组B的儿童被告知，房间里面有一样玩具不可以玩，但违反只会受到轻微惩罚。在一段时间过后，两组儿童均被告知，禁令解除了，可以自由玩玩具。实验结果表明，相比严重惩罚组A的儿童，轻微惩罚组B的儿童很少去玩那个曾被禁止的玩具。同样的解释思路，轻微惩罚组的儿童在面对想玩而又不能玩的「认知失调」时，外部力量（玩玩具会受到轻微惩罚）没有强大到足以缓解这种失调，所以他们需要通过内部力量（主动不去玩玩具）来证明自己行为的合理性（我之所以没有玩玩具是因为我自己不想玩），从而恢复认知平衡。看到玩具剥夺实验是不是也想起你家的小屁孩，或许现在你自己也可以解释为什么你那么严厉禁止他干什么，他却在你不在的时候越会去做。 接下来讨论一下第三个实验研究：努力辩护效应。研究人员也是把实验分为两组，一组被试需要经历严酷的考验才能加入某个组织，而另外一组被试只需要经历很温和的考验就可以加入。然而他们要加入的组织非常无聊，可是经历严酷考验的被试在实验后对这个组织的评价要显著高于对照组。用「认知失调」理论解释这个实验结果：实现某一目标所需的代价越大，这一目标在行为主体心目中的评价就越高，否则就会造成行为和认知态度之间的失调。简单来说，为了规避自我矛盾的情况出现，我们的认知有时会偏离实际情况，自己“欺骗”自己。看到这，是不是有些HR可以认为对求职者的面试门槛越高，求职者会对公司评价越高？这类问题就先留给你去思考。 这次就介绍到这，下一次我们接着讨论：这些实验，以及相应的理论有哪些现实意义？]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[信园： 展信如见，虽好久不见。 你说想看一下我更新博客，就在博客这里给你写封信吧，放心，我加了密，希望不会有人无聊的去破解吧，不过也没什么，至少我们共同认识的人不会这么做。 每次要写点什么，脑袋就一片空白了，哈哈，我都不知道我要搭建这个博客干什么，感觉都写不出东西出来。 我叫你园可以吧，我希望这样做不会引起你有任何不舒服的感觉，我最近有种感觉，别人不开心我会很容易察觉，所以你别不开心，不然可能我为突然而来的心闷心痛而烦恼。 聊聊开心的事，一直以来都是，最开心的就是可以有个人无所不谈，哈哈，那样的时候就是忘记自己现在的时间和状态，专注做一件事，和你聊天也是这样的。 学了点心理学，感觉整个人轻松了一点，因为知道了自己的状态还没那么糟糕，至少开始懂得去了解自己的思考方式和个性变化，其实很多时候人都是害怕一些未知或者不存在的东西，当你明白原来那个东西长那样，其实也没那么可怕。 有一种疗法叫认知行为疗法，说复杂一点就是一步一步逼近事实，一步一步拆穿不合适甚至不正确的原因，再去一点一点做出另外的行为适应新的原因。说简单一点就是要暴露，藏太久就会有毛病。我可能现在只告诉你一个，但是已经能舒坦很多，你也有“亲密”的朋友，我相信你知道我在说什么。 当然，这样说好像把你说成了垃圾桶，我是想说很感谢你能当起这个可以在我跌倒摔得不知所措的时候还能过来帮我拍拍灰的可爱人，说了一句：“我也跌倒过，没人帮不好受”，其实我也一直很乐意当这样的人，只是我也需要有人这么做吧。 我真的不会写东西，写着写着又哑了，就像我跟你讲电话一样，不过我倒是更乐意听你说多一点，有时候听你说着说着会笑什么的，那种感觉比什么都好。↙ 好了，说点别的，我怕那样这样说下去是不是会太肉麻了，但只是心里想什么就说点什么吧，可能这一点美国人做得好一点，至少他们宣传的诚实是做人之本并实践地挺好，我们也在宣传诚信，但由于东方人偏内敛性格的原因，反而更容易说出和做出不符合自己真实感觉的事情。每当这样做一次，人就需要疗养一次，压力也是如此。疗养不来了，就只能躲，躲久了就会怀疑自己的价值，怀疑了自己价值之后再想回来总觉得有堵无形的墙在面前挡着，对面的人在呼喊，自己还在想这堵墙为什么存在，于是就做出我回不去的姿态，对面的人也不再喊了，自己不知觉的也把这堵墙砌好了。说出来是有点悲哀的样子，但是这样状态或许才是每个人应该有的状态。总有一天自己会让一个彻彻底底信得过的人过墙这边来，那个人可能会帮你开扇门，其描述来自的世界会链接你的世界，并渐渐让你接纳链接的更大的世界。我也希望你能相信这一点，真的。 乱说一通说了这些，希望不会给你带来不好的感觉，有的话记得也要告诉我。还有哦，如果有可能的话，我希望能和你一起出去找点喜欢的事情做或者看点美的东西，至少我心里是这么想的。或许这就是想“ask someone out”的感觉，哈哈。 说到这里吧，有机会我会继续写点其他东西，有什么好建议记得告诉我。 愿好！！ 以上。]]></content>
